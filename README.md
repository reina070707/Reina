# Hi there, I'm Reina! 👋

### **Lead Software Engineer in Test (SET) | Applied Mathematics M.S. | C++ Enthusiast**

I am a Tokyo-based Lead Engineer specializing in bridging complex mathematical theories with robust, mission-critical software. I describe myself as a **"Jaja-uma (Unconventional)"** engineer—combining rigorous logic with the passionate chaos of real-world implementation.

Currently, I am diving deep into **Software Quality Engineering** and **Autonomous Mobile Robotics**, ensuring that the robots of the future are as reliable as they are intelligent.
